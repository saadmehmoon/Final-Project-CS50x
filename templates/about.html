<p>Hello World! This is Saad Mehmoon.</p>
<p>I created this WebApp as a Final Project of CS50</p>
<p>I wanted to create something that I can also use in real life.</p>
<p>This is a WebApp that allows you to take notes and save them in a database in a server.</p>
<p>Hence, notes can be shared across various devices.</p>
<p>The code of this project is based on CS50's pset8 (Finance)</p>
