# Final-Project
Hello World! This is a Web App created as CS50's final project
The idea of this is very simple.
You just take a note, save it and then access it from anywhere as it is saved on the server.
Notes can be synced between different devices using this method.
The code is based mainly on Finance as login(), register(), etc are borrowed from there.
I added some functions of my own and also added a bit of touch to the functions borrowed from Finance.
You have the ability to type out a note with a tag and save it.
You can also delete the notes you saved and search through them searching either the tag or the contents of the note itself.
You have to be registered to use this Web Application.
